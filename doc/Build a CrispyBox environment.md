# Build a CrispyBox development environment

This document will walk through building a CrispyBox development environment

But before you do that, you will need a [CrispyBox Bedrock image](to build on).

Once you have a CrispyBox Bedrock image, spin it up and login to CrispyBox using the following credentials:

- Username: `crispybox`
- Password: `crispybox`

# The CrispyBox_build script

The CrispyBox_build script will build your CrispyBox development environment.

I suggest [reading more about what the CrispyBox_build script does](./CrispyBox_build.md) before running it.

# Download and execute the CrispyBox_build script

Once you are ready to build a CrispyBox development environment, type the following commands:

`~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/main/src/CrispyBox_build.sh`

`~$ chmod +x CrispyBox_build.sh`

`~$ ./CrispyBox_build.sh`
